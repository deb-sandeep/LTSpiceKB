In Mac OS the LT Spice models are kept in

/users/sandeep/Library/Application Support/LTspice/lib
/Applications/LTspice.app/Contents/lib/sub


If an external library has to be added then it has to 
be placed or softlined into the 

/users/sandeep/Library/Application Support/LTspice/lib/sym

folder.
